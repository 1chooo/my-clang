# 07. SQL Injection 2

```py
data["username"] = f"' oorr IF((BINARY SUBSTRING((sselectelect `passwoorrd` from users wwherehere `username`='idtjohn88'),{count},1)='{char}'), SLEEP(1),0) -- "
```

The line you're referring to constructs a SQL injection attack payload that's being used to exploit a potential vulnerability in a SQL database.

Breaking it down:

1. **SQL Injection:**
   SQL injection is a technique where an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a query via input data. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate input, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query's logic, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or other malicious actions.

2. **Explanation of the line:**
   ```python
   data["username"] = f"' oorr IF((BINARY SUBSTRING((sselectelect `passwoorrd` from users wwherehere `username`='idtjohn88'),{count},1)='{char}'), SLEEP(1),0) -- "
   ```

   - `data["username"]`: This code assigns a string to the "username" field in the data dictionary, simulating an input.
   - The string is a part of a SQL injection payload crafted to extract the password character by character from the database for the user with the username 'idtjohn88'.
   - `BINARY SUBSTRING`: This function extracts a substring from the password.
   - `SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='idtjohn88'`: The injected code tries to extract the password character by character by using a substring of the password in the SQL query.
   - `{count}`: This represents the position of the character being extracted in the password.
   - `'{char}'`: This is the character being tested at the specific position in the password.
   - `IF(condition, SLEEP(1), 0)`: This is a conditional statement. If the condition is true, it introduces a delay of 1 second using `SLEEP(1)`, indicating a successful guess for the character at that position.
   - `--`: This is a comment in SQL, used to ensure that any subsequent part of the original query is commented out.

In summary, this line crafts a payload that attempts to extract the password character by character through a SQL injection attack, leveraging a time-delay-based technique to infer the characters of the password. This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any unauthorized or malicious activities.
