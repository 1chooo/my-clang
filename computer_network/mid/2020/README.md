### Q3
Please describe the following terms.
- (2 marks) Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
- IP spoofing.
- Packet sniffing.

**Answer:**

### Q4
A message has been sent from source to destination passed by a switch and a router.
- (3 marks) When a protocol on the sending host(source) adds data to the packet header, the process is called data encapsulation. Moreover, each layer has a different term for the altered packet, as shown in the following figure. Please list the term of the packet in Layer2, Layer3, Layer4.
- (4 marks) Briefly explain the encapsulation/decapsulation procedure on the switch and the router.

### Q13
(10 marks) Consider distributing a file of $F = 15 Gbits$  to $N$ peers. The server has an upload rate of $u_s = 30 Mbps$, and each peer has a download rate of $d_{min} = 2 Mbps$ and an upload rate of $u$, For $N = 100$ and $u = 2Mbps$. Calculate the minimum distribution time for both client-server distribution and P2P distribution.
